## Towards quadratic residues

**Read before class:**  Chapter 7, beginning Chapter 8

## Introduction

Recollections of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Application to the totient.

ROO violations.

Using Chinese remainder theorem to compute and to solve equations with composite modulus.

## Squares

p an odd prime hereafter.

Is n a square mod p?  

Theorem:  Half the numbers are squares mod p.
Proof:  Squaring is a 2-to-1 function.

Theorem:  Wilson's Theorem.

Theorem:  Euler's Criterion for squareness.

Corollary:  -1 is a square mod p iff p = 1 mod 4.

## Conclusion

Next week, we develop quadratic reciprocity to study squareness mod p in general.
