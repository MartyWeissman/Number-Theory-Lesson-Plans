## Quadratic residues.  Permutations!

**Read before class:**  Chapter 8.

## Introduction

Recall Wilson's Theorem.  (p-1)! = -1 mod p.
Recall that half of the nonzero numbers are squares mod p.

Call two numbers a-partners, mod p, if xy = a mod p.
If a is square or not, there are lonely numbers or not.

Euler's Theorem:  a is a nonzerosquare mod p iff a^(p-1)/2 = 1 mod p.

Cor:  -1 is a square mod p iff p = 1 mod 4.
Is 2 a square mod p?

The Legendre symbol (a/p).  Multiplicativity.    

## Permutations

The idea of a sign of a permutation. 

1.  Counting transpositions.
2.  Cycle lengths.
3.  Derangements (next time)

## Conclusion

We prove that (a/p) is the sign of the multiplication by a mod p permutation.
Worried about formulae?  They will be provided on the next test.
