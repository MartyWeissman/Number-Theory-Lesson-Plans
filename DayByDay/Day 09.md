## Introduction to modular arithmetic

**Read before class:**  Chapter 5.  Beginning, to page 153.

## Introduction

The innovation of Gauss -- congruence.  If a number $a$ divides the difference of the numbers $b$ and $c$, $b$ and $c$ are said to be congruent relative to $a$.  If not, $b$ and $c$ are noncongruent.  Today, we say $b$ and $c$ are congruent *modulo* $a$.

Congruence notation.  Equivalence relation properties.  Equivalence classes are called congruence classes (modulo $m$).

For computer scientists, "mod" as an operation.  For mathematicians, "mod" as a context -- a world of numbers to live in.

Translation problems.
1.  3x = 1 mod 5.
2.  x = 0 mod p.
4.  xy = 0 mod p.  (Euclid's lemma, restated).
5.  If x = 0 mod m, and m = 0 mod d, then x = 0 mod d.

Translation problems, the other way.  
1.  10 divides x^2 - 1.
2.  If x is a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3, then x is a multiple of 6.

Addition and multiplication.  The well-definedness theorem.

Divisibility by 3 and 9 tests.

Additive inverses.
