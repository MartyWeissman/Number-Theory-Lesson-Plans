## Quadratic Reciprocity!

**Read before class:**  Chapter 8

No quizzes next week.  Happy Turkey Day!  Complete reading of Chapter 8.  

## Introduction

Recall:  Sign of permutations, 3 ways.  Legendre symbol.  Zolotarev's Lemma.  

Fix distinct odd primes p,q.  Statement of QR.

## Part 1 of proof.

Let S = {0,1,...,pq-1}

Bracket notation [a,b] mod [p,q].  

The permutation which sends [a,b] to a + pb.  
The permutation which sends [a,b] to aq + b.

Signs via cycle type and Zolotarev.

## Part 2 of proof

The permutation which sends a + pb to aq + b.
Recall that sign is multiplicative.
So it remains to show that this sign is (-1)^((p-1 / 2) (q-1 / 2))

Counting inversions in sending a + pb to aq + b.

## Conclusion

Next week:  More on Chinese remainder theorem.  Concluding remarks and where does number theory go?
