## Chinese Remainder Theorem

*Note* The ABC's of the $ABC$-Conjecture, by Sean Gasiorek, McHenry 4130, This Wednesday (Nov 2) at 5:30 PM.

*Reminders*  Computers in sections.  Two laptops with Python for each group.  Next group homework due soon!  Midterm feedback quiz.

**Read before class:**  Chapter 7, on the Chinese remainder theorem.

## Introduction

Recollection of the Fermat-Euler theorem.  

Techniques for reducing the exponent.  Repeated use of the Fermat-Euler theorem.

Roots via the Fermat-Euler theorem.

Multiplicative function.  Recollections of sigma_0 and sigma_1.  Statement that the totient is multiplicative.  Computation of the totient for prime powers.

## Chinese remainder theorem.

Pairs of congruences and single congruences.

Chinese Remainder Theorem and proof by pigeonhole principle.

Existence of ROO violations.

Multiplicativity of the totient.

## Conclusion

Where we're going next:  quadratic residues.
