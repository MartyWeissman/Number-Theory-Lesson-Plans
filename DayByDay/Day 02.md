## General solutions to Linear Diophantine Equations, LCM and GCD properties

**Read before class:**  Finish Chapter 1.

**Announcement:**  Discussion sections start tomorrow.  Enroll please!  Quizzes in sections.  24 students per section.  Shift to Monday if possible.  Coursepacks are available.  Mistake in proof of scaling properties in coursepack.

## Introduction

Let's recall the Euclidean algorithm, and it's relation to solubility of linear Diophantine equations (LDEs).  For example, let's take the LDE 33x + 26y = 3.  Can this be solved?

Different kinds of questions:

1.  Does there exist a solution?
2.  How many solutions exist?
3.  Find a solution.
4.  Find all solutions.
5.  Find all solutions algorithmically.
6.  Find all solutions algorithmically as quickly as possible.

Let's start by finding *a* solution algorithmically.  Running the Euclidean algorithm forwards, then backwards, then scaling as needed.

## Activity

Finding another solution (pairs working).  Finding a general form for a solution.  Proving there are no other solutions.

## Part 2

General equation-solving terminology:  homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations.  The introduction of the LCM.

Definition and schematic for the GCD and the LCM.  Hasse diagrams.

Weak LCM implies strong LCM.  Proof:  If m,n are common multiples of a,b, then GCD(m,n) is a common multiple of a,b.  Apply this to m,LCM(a,b), to prove that LCM(a,b) = GCD(m, LCM(a,b)), which means that LCM(a,b) divides m.

Consequence:  general solution of LDE.

## Conclusion

Proof that GCD times LCM equals product, for two positive integers.

Reminder:  discussions in discussion section.  First group homeworks are posted.  Finish reading Chapter 1 in time for your discussion section, and we're on to Chapter 2 on Thursday!
