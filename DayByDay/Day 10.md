## Modular dynamics.

**Read before class:**  Chapter 6

## Introduction

Truth in Diophantine equations and truth in congruences.  Review of reduction.

Now, living in a modular world, we study dynamics.  What happens if you begin with a number, and repeat a process over and over and over again?  

Example:  Mod 7.  Begin with x.  Replace x by 2x + 1.  Repeat.  What pattern do you find?
0,1,3,0,1,3,... or 2,5,4,2,5,4,...

Example:  Mod 8.  Begin with x.  Multiply by 6.  Repeat.  What pattern do you find?
