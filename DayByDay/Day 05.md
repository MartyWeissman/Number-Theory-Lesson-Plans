## Divisor sums, perfect numbers, beginning rational numbers.

**Read before class:**  Finish Chapter 2

## Introduction

The idea of a multiplicative function.  

Review the Divisors of ab, when GCD(a,b) = 1.
Review geometric series.

Multiplicativity of divisor sums.  Computations of sigma_0(n) and sigma_1(n).

## Perfect numbers.

Definitions:  Perfect numbers and Mersenne primes.

Note:  If 2^n - 1 is prime, then n is prime.
Proof: 2^{ab} - 1 = (2^a - 1)(1 + 2^a + \cdots + 2^{a(b-1)}.

From Mersenne primes to perfect numbers:  Euclid's theorem.

Euler's converse.
* Let N = 2^(e_2) 3^(e_3) \cdots be an even perfect number.
* Let p = e_2 + 1.  So N = 2^{p - 1} q if q is the rest of the terms.
* Note e_2 \geq 1, p \geq 2.
* Compute \sigma_1(N) = (2^p - 1) \sigma_1(q).
* Perfect: \sigma_1(N) = 2N = 2^p q.
* So \sigma_1(q) = 2^p q / (2^p - 1) = q + (2^p - 1)^{-1} q.
* So sum of divisors is sum of two divisors.  So q is prime. 
* So q = 2^p - 1, a prime.  So p is prime.


## Rational numbers.

Rational numbers vs. fractions.

Basic facts:  every rational number can be written uniquely as a reduced fraction.

Irrationality of roots.  

## Conclusion

Mediant fractions.  

Preparing for the exam.  I'll send study advice.  No "practice exam".
